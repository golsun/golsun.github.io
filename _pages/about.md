I am a Research Scientist at [Intuit AI Research](https://www.intuit.com/ai/research/), primarily working on large language models (LLMs).  
Before joining Intuit, I worked at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/) and [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/), focusing on natural language processing.

I received my Ph.D. and M.S. degrees from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), and my Bachelor's degree from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/).

If you are a Ph.D. student working on LLMs, LLM agents, symbolic AI, or generative models and are interested in a research internship at Intuit AI Research, please send me an email with your latest CV.

My recent research focuses on:
* Test-time scaling for LLMs  
* Trustworthy LLMs  
* Agentic AI
